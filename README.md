# exoplanet-core

This repository contains the compiled components for the
[exoplanet](https://github.com/exoplanet-dev/exoplanet/) project. They are being
developed here for several reasons, but the main one is that the code in this
repo needs to change at a less frequent cadence than the main exoplanet modeling
code and there is some cost associated with re-compiling the backend. I'm hoping
that this separation will make it easier for people to contribute to the
exoplanet project without dealing with compilation issues. This also means that
some users can use just the computational components here without the heavy
dependencies required by the exoplanet project. This might be useful, for
example, for people who just want a high performance solver for Kepler's
equation or fast quadratically limb-darkened light curves.

## Installation

```bash
python -m pip install exoplanet-core
```

## Usage

Solving Kepler's equation:

```python
from exoplanet_core import kepler

sinf, cosf = ops.kepler(M, e)
```
